# Hi🖐️I'm HuyDNA 
Third-year student 🤓 @ Ho Chi Minh City of Technology (HCMUT), CSE department

* 😄 Eager to learn anything about CS, either purely theoretical topics or practical ones.
* 🤩 Interested in the lower-level workings of a computer.
* 🐤 I mostly work with: C++, Rust Typescript. I understand Python deeply but it's been a long time I coded in this language so may be I'm getting rusty. I know a little Java & Haskell.
* 😨 Really lack practical experiences...
* 😘 Loveeeee Math.
* 🌎 Concerned about Climate change.

## The most important things I've learnt
> When there are multiple solutions requiring varying engineering efforts, stop thinking about the invisible tradeoffs from the customer's view for a while. Think from the perspective of the customers!

> Don't try to structure systems too complicated from the start. Design simpler systems if it suffices to do so!
