## The most important things I've learnt
> When there are multiple solutions requiring varying engineering efforts, stop thinking about the invisible tradeoffs from the customer's view for a while. Think from the perspective of the customers!

> Don't try to structure systems too complicated from the start. Design simpler systems if it suffices to do so!
